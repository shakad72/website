# Assessment Website #
The objective of this website is to demonstrate an understanding of client-side web 
development and mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

To accomplish this the website 
was designed then hosted on GitHub pages where it can then be evaluated. All 
efforts were be made to natively develop the website without the use of CSS or 
JavaScript libraries.
